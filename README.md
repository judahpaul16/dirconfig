 Configure what files should be in what folders using an easy-to-read YAML config file.

## Features

- **File Organization**: Automatically move files based on their extension from one directory to another.
- **Notification System** (Future Feature): Get notified regarding specific events specified in the configuration file.
- **Automated Backups** (Future Feature): Set up scheduled backups for important directories.

## Installation

Install **dirconfig** using pip:

```sh
pip install dirconfig
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yml` file in your working directory with your automation tasks. Here's an example configuration that organizes `.jpg` and `.pdf` files into separate directories:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Organize Downloads
    type: file-organization
    source: /path/to/your/source/directory
    rules:
      - extension: .jpg
        destination: /path/to/your/destination/for/images
      - extension: .pdf
        destination: /path/to/your/destination/for/documents
```

## Usage

**dirconfig** is designed to run as a daemon, monitoring specified directories and automatically organizing files according to the configurations defined in your `config.yml` file.

You can generate a sample `config.yml` file using the following command:

```sh
dirconfig generate
```

### Starting dirconfig

To initiate **dirconfig** and begin the monitoring process, use the following command:

```sh
dirconfig start
```

This command starts **dirconfig**, which then operates in the background. It will watch the source directories specified in your `config.yml` for any changes, organizing files according to your predefined rules.

To run **dirconfig** as a separate process, use the following command:

```sh
dirconfig start &
```

### Command Line Options
```sh
usage: dirconfig [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--log LOG] [--pid PID] {start,stop,generate}

dirconfig Daemon

positional arguments:
  {start,stop,generate}
                        Dirconfig actions to perform

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG       Path to the configuration file
  --log LOG             Path to the log file
  --pid PID             Path to the PID file
```

### Stopping dirconfig

To stop the **dirconfig** daemon, execute:

```sh
dirconfig stop
```

This command stops the background process of **dirconfig**, halting the monitoring and file organization tasks.

### Advanced Management

For long-term operation or deployment, integrating **dirconfig** with system services or process managers can offer more graceful management, including automatic restarts, logging, and simplified start/stop operations.
